This project is all about doing clustering countries based on some selected features such as median age, gdp per capita, life expectancy, extreme poverty level, and human development index. Two different datasets were used for the KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms.

You can access datasets for this clustering analysis at: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report

Both models cluster the 189 countries into 4 different groups, some countries were groupped into different clusters by these algorithms

At the end, you can see the difference between two models on Tableau dashboard png.
